## JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)

### Definition

**JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)** is a **lightweight, text-based data format** used to **represent structured data**.
It is designed to be **easy for humans to read and write** and **easy for machines to parse and generate**.

JSON is based on a **key–value structure** and is widely used for **data storage, configuration, and communication between systems**.

---

## Core Properties of JSON

- Text-based and platform-independent
- Uses a simple and minimal syntax
- Represents data in a structured, hierarchical form
- Unicode-supported (international characters supported)
- Deterministic and strict in syntax

---

## JSON Data Types

JSON supports the following **six data types**:

1. **String**
   Text data enclosed in double quotes

   ```json
   "name": "Kamran"
   ```

2. **Number**
   Integer or floating-point values

   ```json
   "age": 21
   ```

3. **Boolean**
   Logical values

   ```json
   "isActive": true
   ```

4. **Null**
   Represents an empty or unknown value

   ```json
   "middleName": null
   ```

5. **Object**
   A collection of key–value pairs

   ```json
   {
     "id": 1,
     "title": "Syntax Converter"
   }
   ```

6. **Array**
   An ordered list of values

   ```json
   ["JavaScript", "Python", "C++"]
   ```

## JSON Structure

### JSON Object

- Enclosed in `{ }`
- Contains one or more key–value pairs
- Keys must be strings
- Values can be any valid JSON data type

```json
{
  "user": "Kamran",
  "score": 95,
  "verified": true
}
```

---

### JSON Array

- Enclosed in `[ ]`
- Maintains order
- Can store mixed data types

```json
["JSON", 2025, true, null]
```

---

## JSON Syntax Rules (Strict)

- Keys **must** be enclosed in double quotes
- Strings **must** use double quotes
- No trailing commas allowed
- No comments allowed
- Case-sensitive keywords (`true`, `false`, `null`)

**Invalid JSON**

```json
{
  "name": "Kamran"
}
```

**Valid JSON**

```json
{
  "name": "Kamran"
}
```

---

## JSON Encoding

- Encoded using **UTF-8**
- Supports all Unicode characters
- Special characters are escaped using backslashes

```json
{
  "path": "C:\\Users\\Kamran"
}
```

---

## JSON Formatting

### Minified JSON

Compact and space-efficient

```json
{ "a": 1, "b": 2 }
```

### Pretty-Printed JSON

Readable and structured

```json
{
  "a": 1,
  "b": 2
}
```

---

## JSON Parsing Model

- JSON represents data as **trees**
- Objects are nodes
- Arrays are ordered branches
- Values are leaves

This predictable structure makes JSON reliable for transformation and validation.

---

## JSON Constraints

- No support for functions
- No comments
- No date type (dates are strings)
- No references or circular structures
- Schema is not enforced by default

---

## JSON Determinism

- Same input always produces the same structure
- Order matters in arrays
- Object key order is not guaranteed logically, only syntactically
