# Binary

Binary is a base-2 number system that uses only two digits: 0 and 1. It is fundamental to how computers process and store data.

## How Binary Works

In binary, each digit represents a power of 2:

- The rightmost digit represents 2^0 (1)
- The next digit to the left represents 2^1 (2)
- The next digit represents 2^2 (4)
- And so on...

For example, the binary number `1011` can be converted to decimal as follows:
1 _ 2^3 + 0 _ 2^2 + 1 _ 2^1 + 1 _ 2^0 = 8 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 11

## Converting Between Binary and Decimal

To convert a decimal number to binary:

1. Divide the number by 2
2. Record the remainder
3. Continue dividing the quotient by 2 until it becomes zero
4. Read the remainders from bottom to top

To convert a binary number to decimal:

1. Multiply each digit by its corresponding power of two
2. Sum all the products to get the decimal equivalent

## Example

```
Binary 1111 = Decimal 15
```
